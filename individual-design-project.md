# Project 2

## Description

For this project, you will produce a digital design work that critically engages with the project's theme. You will also develop a design concept, production process, and a well-articulated work statement to explains your work to a wide audience. Your work will then be collectively displayed in a online exhibition visible to the Penn State community.

Avoid basing your project on existing intellectual properties \(movies, comics, games, etc.\) unless you do something conceptually sophisticated like a parody, deconstruction, or appropriation.

## Project Theme: *SLOW*

> Informed and inspired by the principles of the Slow Food and Slow Cities movements, the slow design principles offer a flexible, pluralistic approach for designers to gently evaluate themselves as to the true purpose of their design activities

— [The Slow Design Movement](https://www.archiblox.com.au/slow-design-movement/) by Archiblox

> Why is it so hard to slow down? I think there are various reasons. One is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy. It's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up. I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension — that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger, deeper questions.

– Carl Honoré [In Praise of slowness](https://www.ted.com/talks/carl_honore_in_praise_of_slowness) TED Talk

In the 1980s, the [slow food movement](https://www.slowfood.com/) began in Europe as a reaction to American fast food, and sought to promote traditional methods of farming and eating. The philosophy has spread to other sectors, where everything from architecture to product design can be designed to embrace local resources, sustainability, and an appreciation of quiet details. 

Today, the harmful effects of the attention-economy and the relentless optimization of digital experiences are widely recognized, including by artist Jenny Odell in her 2019 book [How To Do Nothing](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/600671/how-to-do-nothing-by-jenny-odell/9781612197494/). Odell sees the act of sitting still as a form of resistance in a world that seems to constantly speed up. For a shorter look at Odell's ideas and her artwork, see the link below.

“Slow Design” is a term used by some creators, and includes some specific attributes \(see below\), but you do not have to strictly adhere to its principles for this project. 

Explore the links below and consider how these approaches to creative work relate to your own interests. Rather than a multitude of fast-paced, low-interaction experiences, imagine longer, more nuanced ones: quality over quantity. You can explore the theme of slowness literally, or focus on related topics like sustainability, participatory design, mindfulness, anti-capitalism, or traditional crafts.

## Principles of Slow Design 

\(According to [Archiblox](https://www.archiblox.com.au/slow-design-movement/)\)

1. Reveal: Highlight things that might go unnoticed.
2. Expand: Look beyond obvious meanings and uses to discover potential applications.
3. Reflect: Create work that invites reflection and awareness of context.
4. Engage: Connect with open-source projects, collaborators, or communities. 
5. Participate: Invite users to participate in the design process.
6. Evolve: Imagine how your work will live on beyond the immediate future.

## Project media

If you are unsure of what types of digital projects are available to create, please have a look at the [project categories](/project-categories.md). This is not a comprehensive list, but you should be able to locate your own creative interests within.

## Online Exhibition

Project Two will culminate in an online exhibition of student work. Exhibitions typically have a central theme—a conceptual thread that links the work together. Your instructor will coordinate the online exhibition and will be accessible to anyone with Penn State login credentials.

## Rubric

All project deliverables must be met for the project to be graded. A non-submission or non-completion for any part of the project is considered an incomplete project.

1. Met all deliverable requirements: 20%
2. Project outcomes: 
   * Concept: 20%
   * Craft: 20%
   * Work Statement: 20%
   * Participation in online exhibition: 20%
