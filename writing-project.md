# Writing Project

As you develop your independent project, this essay will serve as an opportunity to discover relevant practitioners and creative work that can inform your own project. Researching, organizing your thoughts, and articulating them in writing are absolutely essential skills for any designer. 

Of a group of applicants for a job or project, the best writer will have a serious advantage. Plus spending time thinking critically about your work and life is always valuable to do. 

## Prompt

### The title of your essay should be a question

What questions do you have about the ideas, feasibility, or historical context of your own work? What unexpected connections can you make? What is missing? What is confusing? The title of your essay should end in a question mark and should seek to discover a specific answer (or possible answers) to this question or explore its context.

### Analyze a specific work by an artist, designer, filmmaker, or studio

Incorporate a focused discussion of one creative work or project into your essay. This should somehow relate to your project, research topics, and/or the media you are interested in. Resources for discovering interesting work can be found at the bottom of this page.

- You are encouraged to look for new, obscure, historical, or otherwise thought-provoking creators ‚Äî not just mainstream pop culture.
- **Include a thorough and detailed description of the work's design**¬†‚Äî Assume your reader has not seen the work before. Describe formal qualities such as, colors, shapes, movement, structure, and so on. Use descriptive adjectives to help the reader picture the work.
- **Include the work title, date, medium, and location (as relevant)**
- Describe pertinent historical context for the work.
- Include credible scholarly sources to support claims and information.

### Include 1‚Äì2 related works

These secondary works should not be a primary focus of the essay, but can offer additional context or comparisons to the primary work under discussion. These could be contemporary works by peers or historical precedents; they could be similar or antithetical \(in opposition to\) to the primary work. 

### Not sure where to begin?

1. You could start with an artist or designer, and pose a question that intrigues you about their work, or suggests a possible connection to your project.
2. Consider the historical precedents or themes of your current or past projects, and find writing and creative work that lies in a similar orbit.
3. This writing should be though of as art or design criticism (a critical and reasoned examination of a cultural object). Consider your unique point-of-view and identity; choose a subject that you are passionate about.
4. Imagine someone else was writing a serious essay about your work, what connections or questions would they include?
5. Use a chatbot like ChatGPT to think through your ideas or discover practitioners or writing related to your investigation. You can even tell it to *ask you questions*, if you're feeling stuck, to provoke introspection or curiosity. 

## Visual Outline

To begin this project, create a virtual whiteboard using [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/), [Miro](https://miro.com/?adgroupid=140324301065&matchtype=e&device=c&location=9052639&gad_source=1), [Mural](https://www.mural.co/), or something comparable. 

Use this as a brain-storming and note-taking hub for your project, similar to the beginning of Project 1 in this class. 

- Brainstorm possible ‚Äútopic questions‚Äù for the essay.
- List possible artists or designers and their specific works.
- Add images, links, and quotes to collect resources for the essay.

FigJam includes a [Mind map](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/18917944627095-Create-mindmaps-in-FigJam) feature that is very helpful in exploring related ideas from a central topic and generating possible research topics.

As you collect ideas and resources, begin to **organize them into essay sections**. Use text headings and spatial organization to indicate the ‚Äústory‚Äù you will tell in the essay. For example, you might have sections like ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù or ‚ÄúHistorical influences‚Äù and list what you will write about in each section \(much like a written outline and bibliography, but with pictures\).

Search for articles and ebooks at the¬†[Penn State Library](https://libraries.psu.edu/)¬†or¬†[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)

üì•¬†**Submission:** The Visual Outline will be due as a preliminary assignment ahead of the main essay.
