# Writing project


## 1. Analyze a specific work by an artist, designer, filmmaker, or studio

Incorporate a discussion of one creative work or project into your essay. This should somehow relate to your central line of investigation, and relate to media you are interested in.

-  You are encouraged too look for new, obscure, historical, or otherwise thought-provoking creators — not just mainstream pop culture. 
- **Include a thorough and detailed description of the work's design** — Assume your reader has not seen the work before. Describe formal qualities such as, colors, shapes, movement, structure, and so on. Use descriptive adjectives to help the reader picture the work.
- **Include the work title, date, medium, and location \(as relevant\)**
- Describe pertinent historical context for the work.
- Include credible scholarly sources to support claims and information.

## 2. The title of your essay should be a question

What questions do you have about the ideas, feasibility, or historical context of your work? What unexpected connections can you make? What is missing? What is confusing? The title of your essay should end in a question mark and should seek to discover an answer \(or possible answers\) to this question or explore the context that gave rise to the question. 


## 3. Citations

To support your arguments and explore the work of your chosen artist, incorporate quotes or data from a minimum of three published sources. Do not cite Wikipedia \(but you can peruse the citations of a Wikipedia page to find authoritative sources\).

Search for articles and ebook at the [Penn State Library](https://libraries.psu.edu/) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)


## 4. Not sure where to begin?

1. You could start with an artist or designer, and pose a question that intrigues you about their work, or suggests a possible connection to your project.
2. Consider the historical or theoretical context of one of your current or past projects, and find writing and creative work that lies in a similar orbit. 
3. This writing should be though of as art or design criticism \(a critical and reasoned examination of a cultural object\). Consider your unique point-of-view and feel free to choose a subject that you are passionate about.
4. Imagine someone else was writing a serious essay about your work, what connections or questions would they include?
