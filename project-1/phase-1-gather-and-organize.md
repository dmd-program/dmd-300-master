# Phase 1: Gather and organize

Meet with your team and begin to establish meeting times and meeting agendas. 

## Agenda items for design meetings

The following are some recommended items to consider for meeting agendas. Ultimately, you are responsible for crafting meeting agendas:

1. Introductions or icebreaker
2. Read through the project document, look at provided resources, and discuss any questions about the project that the team may have \(Please send questions to your instructor if you are still unclear after this discussion\).
3. Decide on team collaboration tools. A more comprehensive list is located on the [collaboration tools page](/collaboration-tools.md).
4. Identify meeting times.
5. Discuss types of digital media workflows, tools, and formats that are of interest to the group.
6. Identify design challenges or topics. It may be beneficial to bring some ideas to the initial meeting, or to convene a second meeting later to spend more time discussing. The project's focus word is meant to give you a starting point, and guide any design thinking activities, similar to the ones used in the Double Diamond process in DMD100. You can [refer back to DMD100](https://dmd-program.gitbooks.io/dmd-100-sp19/content/) at any time if you do not recall the activities that were used. 
7. Decide whether to assign team member roles. If roles are desired, what are they and who are they assigned to?
8. Determine clear project outcomes and goals.
