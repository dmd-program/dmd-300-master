# Phase 3: Pitch

Produce a short presentation that explains the project concept. Use presentation slide software to design the presentation and record a video presenting the slides in a professional manner. You can include voice narration or on screen text to explain what we're looking at. Please include:

1. **Slideshow Video:** Clearly legible text or voice narration
   * If doing voice narration, you can choose one team member to narrative, or have different members contribute narration of different slides.
2. **PDF export** of slides used for the video.

* [How to record your screen with Quicktime](https://support.apple.com/guide/quicktime-player/record-your-screen-qtp97b08e666/mac) \(Mac\). Other screen-recording software is available online. Do this if you want to record a Google Slide presentation.
* Audio recording programs:
  * [Audacity](https://manual.audacityteam.org/index.html): free open-source audio recording; [tutorial](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/tutorial_your_first_recording.html) for how to record with computer mic.
  * Adobe Audition: available with PSU Adobe account; professional grade audio editor. [Here's a tutorial ](https://helpx.adobe.com/audition/using/recording-audio.html)for recording a simple audio file. 
* How to reduce video filesize \(if your video is larger than 500MB or taking forever to upload\):
  * Use Adobe Media Encoder to resize or compress a video file \(without editing it, if you want to trim a video or do complex editing, use Adove Premiere\).
  * [This video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b-jHxjdEWE)shows how to reduce the bitrate \(i.e. quality\) of the video to lower the file size. You can also choose to resize the video; e.g. from 1080p \(1920px x 1080px\) to 720p \(1280px x 720px\). 

## Submission details:

1. Post the pitch to the project blog.
2. Upload a .zip file to the canvas assignment that includes:
   * Pitch video \(Please export/compress this video. It should be less the 500MB in filesize\)
   * PDF export of the slides

Note: only one person in the group needs to submit the file to the group assignment.
