# Phase 3: Pitch

Produce a short presentation that explains the project concept. Use presentation slide software to design the presentation and record a video presenting the slides in a professional manner. You can include voice narration or on screen text to explain what we're looking at. Please include:

1. **Slideshow Video:** Clearly legible text or voice narration
   * If doing voice narration, you can choose one team member to narrative, or have different members contribute narration of different slides.
2. **PDF export** of slides used for the video.

The video should be fun and engaging! Imagine you are pitching this potential stakeholders or investors. Use bold imagery and visual design. Don't put long passages of text on a slide an then read it to us. Keep it simple and conversational. 

Here's a [gallery of real pitch decks](https://visme.co/blog/best-pitch-decks/) from startups that you can look at for inspiration. Note that these are for businesses, and therefore focus on markets and profit more than is appropriate here. **This is not a business class!** You don't need a strategy to make money, and for some projects you might imagine you have an unlimited budget and develop a speculative design that never leaves the imagination stage. For other projects, you might create a real website, ad campaign, or comic book. Focus on applying [design thinking](/design-process-and-methods.md) to your problem and demonstrating creative problem-solving, attention to craft and detail, and sophisticated visual design. 

## Required Slides

Include slides dedicated to the following topics, though you don't have to use these exact titles and you can put them in any order:

- **Problem:** How things are now; establish the context for why your idea is needed or interesting. 
- **Solution:** Introduce your core idea, using additional slides to flesh it out. Include images or sketches depicting how the final project might appear.
- **Inspiration/Competitors:** Show images of related work guiding your aesthetic style, or similar products you can study for reference.
- **User/Audience report:** Describe the intended audience for your project, such as:
  - [Demographic data​](https://www.ala.org/magirt/publicationsab/demdata)
  - [Digital fluency](https://www.digitalfluency.guide/digital-fluency/introduction-to-digital-fluency)
  - Qualitative, interviews, or anecdotal info ​
  - Challenges or obstacles ​
  - Cultural background or context ​
- **[Empathy Map](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/)**: A concise picture of the audience above. This diagram comes from UX research, but can be applied to other types of design too. 
  

## Requirements 
- Must include topics above, including images as described.
- Video should be 3-5 minutes long.
