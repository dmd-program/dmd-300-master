# Phase 2: Develop a design sprint

## What's a Design Sprint?

Developed by GV \(Google Ventures, a subsidiary of Alphabet\), a design sprint is a specific format to develop solutions to a design problem. Read their [explanation of the process](https://www.thesprintbook.com/how) or watch this [90 second video explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2vSQPh6MCE). 

The GV Design Sprint is supposed to be an accelerated design process that packs brainstorming, prototyping, and user testing into five days. We won't follow their methods exactly, but the links above may help guide you as you design a process that works for your group and schedule.

For Phase 2 of this project, each group will:
- Evaluate your existing project ideas in a [group blog post](http://sites.psu.edu)
- Prepare a Design Sprint timeline based on your preferred idea.


## Create a Blog: 

Your group's blog should be hosted using [Sites at Penn State](http://sites.psu.edu) \(which uses Wordpress\). Your team should use this blog to track the progress of the project and to show interesting project outcomes.

* [You can add multiple users](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-add-new-users-and-authors-to-your-wordpress-blog/) to a blog so everyone can edit and create posts. 
* If any project team members are concerned about privacy, project members may use a pseudonym \(pen name\) and in addition, the blog is able to be password protected to Penn State WebAccess users. Please contact your instructor if this is a concern and need help with blog configuration.

### Your first post: *Ideation Scrimmage!*

Take the three project ideas generated in last week's "Gather & Organize" exercise and evaluate them based on the following criteria. For each idea, copy and paste the text below and respond to the prompts:

**Abstract**: One sentence summary (Media/subject/style)

**How does this address the prompt of inclusive design?**

**Minimum viable product:** What is a simple deliverable that you are 100% confident you could produce in the coming weeks?

**Stretch goals:** What would be really cool, but you’re not sure it’s feasible/possible?

**Unique value proposition:** How does this project differ from existing products or work? Or, What makes it stand out as something only your group could make?

**Devil’s advocate**: Describe a poor, boring, or problematic result for this project — what would failure look like? 

**Safeguards:** How can you avoid the outcome described above?

**Resources needed:** What new skills or resources are required for this, or things you want to learn more about?

**Rating:** Rank your three ideas with a number 1–3 \(with 1 being the idea your group likes best\) 

You are welcome to write more about your ideas or process as desired. 

## Design Sprint Timeline

After evaluating the three ideas, **choose one** to pursue for the remainder of this project. 

Use the [document template provided here](https://pennstateoffice365.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/SoVAOnlineFacultyHub/ETV8ePZvcPZIvLv4kAAUvO4BYxoaKWFAgurWBskB5RtA7g?e=sfERnN). You can copy the file into your shared Teams workspace so your group mates can edit them. 

This document is separate from the blog post, and will function as an agreement among your partners and act as a roadmap for the next few weeks. 


## Submission details:

1. Publish a link to the project blog on the classwide Canvas discussion.
2. Submit a completed design sprint document \(PDF or DOC\) to the relevant Canvas assignment.
