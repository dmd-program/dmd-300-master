# Production reports

A production report is a comprehensive update about what progress has been made. A report can consist of any visual or text description and may include screenshot images, photographs of prototypes, video of working functionality, code snippets, production artwork, concept maps, research findings, work inspiration, storyboards and scripts, etc. Include hyperlinks to your research sources, tutorials you followed, or other influences on your work!

**Each blog post should be a minimum of 500 words long, and images or other media.**

## Focus on AI

At least one of your blog posts should include an in-depth report on your use of AI tools.

- Explain what tools you used.
- Describe or show your input data.
- What challenges or surprises did you encounter?
- What did it feel like? How do these tools change your professional expectations or capabilities?
