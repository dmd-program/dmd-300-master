# Project 2

## Description

For this project, you will produce a digital design work that critically engages with the project's theme. You will also develop a design concept, production process, and a well-articulated work statement to explains your work to a wide audience. This is an opportunity to work on a project over a longer period and focus your creative interests in anticipation of the capstone course \(DMD-400\).

## Project Topic: A.I.

Algorithms have shaped our relationship to culture ever since social media feeds and streaming recommendations became dominant venues for creative work. But so-called artificial intelligence tools like image and text generators are evolving at [exponential rates](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/) and offer new possibilities to artists and designers, while simultaneously [threatening](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/121lhfq/i_lost_everything_that_made_me_love_my_job/) entire creative fields with the possibility of automation. So let‚Äôs think about what this means for our future, and see what current AI tools can bring to our workflows.

## Required Readings

**üìî¬†*You Look Like a Thing and I Love You* by Janelle Shane (2019)**

- What is AI? (pg. 1‚Äì28)

See PDF posted on Canvas.

After exploring hilarious AI-fails on her blog for many years, Janelle Shane explains how AI works (or doesn‚Äôt work) with the help of delightful illustrations. The book goes into some detail about specific algorithms and learning models used for AI, but this introductory chapter is very accessible and should pull back the curtain a little and help you think about AI as a tool and not the magical force it sometimes feel like. 

**üìî¬†*Futureproof: 9 Rules for Humans in the Age of Automation* by Kevin Roose (2021)**

- Part 2, Rule 4: Leave Handprints (pg. 115‚Äì130)
- Appendix: Making a Futureproof Plan (pg. 203‚Äì027)

[Access ebook through Penn State library](https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/33839629)

This book explores the state of AI-driven automation in knowledge industries like journalism, tech, business, and ‚Äî yes, design. Roose is a New York Times contributor and co-host of the tech podcast [Hard Fork](https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork). He also made headlines in 2023 for [a conversation](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-transcript.html) with Bing's AI chatbot, where the program called itself Sydney and proclaimed its love for Roose.

In ***Futureproof***. Roose outlines nine rules for living and working in the ‚Äúage of automation.‚Äù The fourth rule, ‚ÄúLeave Handprints‚Äù is one of the most applicable to artists and designers, but the other rules all offer useful approaches to maintaining a healthy mind and creative practice. So I‚Äôm also asking you to read the short appendix, where Roose shares actual examples of how to apply his rules to everyday life. 

## Instructions

Use something generated by AI in your project. 

This could take the form of text, images, videos, music, or other media assets that you insert into a creative project. 

Or you could us AI tools as part of your process: to brainstorm ideas, discover visual inspiration, layouts, narratives, etc. For example, you could generate some AI poster designs, and then create higher quality posters yourself using colors and layout ideas from the AI-generated images. You could generate a list of possible design solutions to a UX problem, or a short story to illustrate with original comic artwork. 

Beyond process or materials, what should your project be ***about?*** That‚Äôs up to you, but you could consider the topics of artificial intelligence, automation, labor, robots, consciousness, human-ness, or other ideas related to the process we will use. Often when the concept of your work aligns with the form, sparks happen and everything becomes stronger. 

These topics are not required; you can choose any subject for your project and simply use AI tools to generate something.

## Resources

üóìÔ∏è *As of August 2023 \(New tools or updates may be available\)*

üö® *Any text, images, or media you put into these tools will be used to train and improve AI programs. For that reason do not share overly private information or media, and if you have concerns, contact your instructor.*

### Text

**Premium Choice:** [Chat GPT-4](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/): A paid upgrade on the free model, and you can use plugins to let it browse the web, execute code, and interact with third party APIs. 

**Free Recommendations:**

- [Chat GPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/): Fast and easy to use, can generate code; cannot browse the web to find latest information.
- [Bing](https://www.bing.com): Runs a mix of GPT 3.5 and 4, including ability to search the web and "see" images to analyze them. A little more creative and weird than the other models, and therefore great for brainstorming ideas. 
- [Bard](https://bard.google.com/): Google's AI chatbot can run code and "see" images to analyze them.
- [Google Docs](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/13447609?hl=en): Currently available only as a beta-release, you can generate and edit text directly in Google Docs. To request access, sign up for Google Workspace Labs at the link above. 
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/): Competitive with GPT-4 and notable for having an insanely large context window, meaning you can paste in entire books for it to transform, summarize, or interact with.
- [Lex](https://lex.page/): An AI-assisted text editor, if you prefer that to a chat interface. Write a document and let the AI continue your ideas, generate text, or develop notes into full text.

**Example propmts**:

- "How might a mobile app help library visitors engage with books in a new way?"
- "Write the copy for a landing page about an eco-conscious clothing company. Include section headings and use fun, pithy language that would appeal to teeangers."
- "I'm developing a fantasy video game, list some potential names for a magical island inhabited by pirates."
- "Who are some artists working with animation and site-specific projection?"
- "Help me write a comic about a conversation between a robot and a butterfly. Use script formatting, and include a visual description of each frame."

Remember that you can follow-up your prompts with more specifics to "steer" the response in the direction you want. You might have to help the chatbot along a few times to produce the kind of results you're looking for. 


### Images

**Premium Choice**: [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/): A fantastic tool that is worth a month of subscription to try it out. Uses a simple interface via Discord, where you type commands to generate or modify images. Follow their [quick start guide](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/quick-start) and read about the many [commands](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/command-list) and [parameters](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/parameter-list) available to customize your results. 


**Free Recommendations:**

- [Bing Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/images/create): Uses DALL-E model, and is pretty great and easy to use. 
- [Playground](https://playgroundai.com): A powerful GUI for generating images with Stable Diffussion; 1000 free images and licensed for commercial use. 
- [Adobe Firefly](https://firefly.adobe.com/): Notable for the fact that its AI model was trained exclusively on images Adobe owns \(through Adobe Stock\), so it is not exploiting artists by copying their style, if that's a concern for you. 

**Example Prompts**
- "A photograph of a man lounging under a tree on a summer afternoon, golden hour, cinematic bokeh, sepia colors."
- "A cartoon illustration of watermelon hugging a tomato, vibrant colors and radiating lines of energy." 

Use very descriptive language, references to specific art styles, camera terms, or art media. You can alter the prompt if the results aren't to your liking, and remember that Midjourney has very specific [parameters](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/parameter-list) to help guide the resulting images. 

Most of these tools will generate 4 images at once, and you can pick your favorite one to scale up to a higher resolution. 

**Other Image Tools:**

- [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/): Owned by OpenAi, who makes Chat-GPT, this tool offers a limited number of free images before you have to pay for them.
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces): A vast library of user-created tools built on popular machine-learning systems, including some visual interfaces for the open source Stable Diffusion.
- [Spline Style Transfer](https://spline.design/ai-style-transfer): Spline is a cool web-based 3D modeling app, and while they're still working on a true "text-to-3D" model, you can use text prompts to generate images based on your 3D models, trying out new color or aesthetic ideas in an instant. 
- [Icons8 Upscaler](https://icons8.com/upscaler): Most generative image tools create fairly small images, so this AI tool can be used to scale them up them to larger sizes.

**Advanced Use of Stable Diffusion:** 

As an open-source model, you can do an awful lot with [Stable Diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/) if you're comfortable with some coding, including integrating it with other applications.

- [Overview and tips on running SD locally](https://www.jonstokes.com/p/stable-diffusion-20-and-21-an-overview)
- [Beginners guide to using Stable Diffusion on Google Colab](https://bytexd.com/get-started-with-stable-diffusion-google-colab-for-ai-generated-art/)
- [Using your own training images with Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth](https://bytexd.com/how-to-use-dreambooth-to-fine-tune-stable-diffusion-colab/) (to generate images similar to your own input images)

### Video & Sound

**Premium Choice:** [Runway](https://runwayml.com/ai-magic-tools/): A host of tools, including many for transforming video clips: remove background, enhance audio, remove objects, add subtitles, text-to-color-grade, text-to-3D, bokeh simulation, and more. Now with "text-to-video" generation! 

**More:**

- [EBSyth](https://ebsynth.com/): Generate video and animations based on an input video + an input image. See FAQ page for tutorials. 
- [Pollinations](https://replicate.com/pollinations): A collection of experimental AI tools with a free trial and then paid results; includes text-to-music and video generation, tools for animating still images, and more.
- [ElevenLabs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/): Generate realistic speech form text, including the ability to upload recordings to use as a basis for the synthetic voice.
