# Project 2

## Description

For this project, you will produce a digital design work that critically engages with the project's theme. You will also develop a design concept, production process, and a well-articulated work statement to explains your work to a wide audience. Your work will then be collectively displayed in a class-wide online exhibition.

## Project Topic: AI

Algorithms have shaped our relationship to culture ever since social media feeds and streaming recommendations became dominant venues for creative work. But so-called artificial intelligence tools like image and text generators are evolving at exponential rates and offer new possibilities to artists and designers, while simultaneously threatening entire creative fields with the possibility of automation. So let‚Äôs think about what this means for our future, and see what current AI tools can bring to our workflows.

## Required Readings

**üìî¬†*You Look Like a Thing and I Love You* by Janelle Shane (2019)**

- What is AI? (pg. 1‚Äì28)

See PDF posted on Canvas.

After exploring hilarious AI-fails on her blog for many years, Janelle Shane explains how AI works (or doesn‚Äôt work) with the help of delightful illustrations. The book goes into some detail about specific algorithms and learning models used for AI, but this introductory chapter is very accessible and should pull back the curtain a little and help you think about AI as a tool and not the magical force it sometimes feel like. 

**üìî¬†*Futureproof: 9 Rules for Humans in the Age of Automation* by Kevin Roose (2021)**

- Part 2, Rule 4: Leave Handprints (pg. 115‚Äì130)
- Appendix: Making a Futureproof Plan (pg. 203‚Äì027)

[Access ebook through Penn State library](https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/33839629)

This book explores the state of AI-driven automation in knowledge industries like journalism, tech, business, and ‚Äî yes, design. Roose is a New York Times contributor and co-host of the tech podcast Hard Fork. In **************Futureproof,************** he outlines nine rules for living and working in the ‚Äúage of automation.‚Äù The fourth rule, ‚ÄúLeave Handprints‚Äù is one of the most applicable to artists and designers, but the other rules all offer useful approaches to maintaining a healthy mind and creative practice. So I‚Äôm also asking you to read the short appendix, where Roose shares actual  examples of how to apply his rules to everyday life. 

## Instructions

Use something generated by AI in your project. 

This could take the form of text, images, videos, music, patterns, or other media assets that you insert into a creative project. 

Or you could us AI tools as part of your process: to brainstorm ideas, visual inspiration, layouts, narratives, etc. For example, you could generate some AI poster designs, and then create higher quality posters yourself using colors and layout ideas from the AI-generated images. You could generate a list of possible design solutions to a UX problem, or a short story to illustrate with original comic artwork. 

Beyond process or materials, what should your project be ******about?****** That‚Äôs up to you, but you could consider the topics of artificial intelligence, automation, labor, robots, consciousness, human-ness, or other ideas related to the process we will use. (These topics are not required; you can choose any subject for your project and simply use AI tools to generate something.)

- [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/): Text-to-image generator from OpenAI. Get 50 free images on signup, then 15 images per month, or pay for more.
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces): Browse a library of user-created tools built on popular machine-learning systems. Such as:
    - [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion): A simple interface for using the open-source image generator.
    - [Finetuned Difussion](https://huggingface.co/spaces/anzorq/finetuned_diffusion) : Similar to above, but with controls to guide and define the resulting images.
    - [Stable Difussion Multi-Inpainting](https://huggingface.co/spaces/multimodalart/stable-diffusion-inpainting): Add generated imagery to an existing image.
    - [DALL-E Mini](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini) : A simplified version of the popular DALLL-E image generator.

### Animations

- [Pollinations.ai](http://Pollinations.ai): An artist-run website offering AI tools, including some video creation tools, freaky dreamscapes, and [Stable Diffusion Animation](https://pollinations.ai/create/stablediffusion), which generate an animation that interpolates between two different images generated from text prompts
- [Talking Face Generation](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CVPR/ml-talking-face): Create a video of an AI-generated face speaking whatever text you give it.

### Collections

- [Creativity with AI](https://creativitywith.ai/library/): A library of AI tools for creating images, patterns, sounds, text, and more.

### Plugins

- Figma
    - [Magician](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1151890004010191690): Generate icons, copy, and images from text prompts.
    - [Ando](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1145446664512862540): Generate designs and imagery from vector shapes, layouts, and text prompts.
- Photoshop

- VS Code
    - [GitHub CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot): Generate working code in a variety of languages, based on prompts or snippets.

### Advanced

For more custom results, you can run some of these image generation algorithms yourself. Running these operations locally on your computer requires a lot of RAM, but Google offers a cloud computing platform called Colab, where you can run programs virtually. 

- [Beginners guide to using Stable Diffusion on Google Colab](https://bytexd.com/get-started-with-stable-diffusion-google-colab-for-ai-generated-art/)
- [Using your own training images with Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth](https://bytexd.com/how-to-use-dreambooth-to-fine-tune-stable-diffusion-colab/) (to generate images similar to your own input images)


Feel free to use other AI tools besides these!

## Project media

If you are unsure of what types of digital projects are available to create, please have a look at the list of [digital design project types](/digital-design-project-types.md). This is not a comprehensive list, but you should be able to locate your own creative interests within.

## Online Exhibition

Exhibitions typically have a central theme‚Äîa conceptual thread that links the work together. Exhibition curators contextualize selected works which often ascribes new or additional meaning to the individual works as a result. The online exhibition's theme will be chosen after student projects are completed. DMD 300 online exhibitions are designed to run back to back, and will last until the next cohort of DMD 300 students participate. This makes the exhibition duration somewhat variable, but should not last more than one year and no less than a single semester. Your instructor will coordinate the exhibition, which will be available in two options; a Penn State only online exhibition, and a fully public online exhibition. Students choosing to participate in the fully public exhibition will also have their work shown in the Penn State only exhibition. Students participating in the Penn State only exhibition will not have work shown in the fully public exhibition. The fully public exhibition will be maintained on the DMD program website as an archive after the exhibition has ended‚Äîincorporating willing students' work into the program's heritage.
