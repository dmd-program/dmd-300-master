# Project 2

## Description

For this project, you will produce a digital design work that critically engages with the project's theme. You will also develop a design concept, production process, and a well-articulated work statement to explains your work to a wide audience. This is an opportunity to work on a project over a longer period and focus your creative interests in anticipation of the capstone course \(DMD-400\).

## Project Topic: A.I.

Algorithms have shaped our relationship to culture ever since social media feeds and streaming recommendations became dominant venues for creative work. But so-called artificial intelligence tools like image and text generators are evolving at [exponential rates](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/) and offer new possibilities to artists and designers, while simultaneously [threatening](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/121lhfq/i_lost_everything_that_made_me_love_my_job/) entire creative fields with the possibility of automation. So let‚Äôs think about what this means for our future, and see what current AI tools can bring to our workflows.

If you're not super familiar with generative AI tools, explore the links and examples further down this page before completing the reading and videos below.

## Required Reading/Watching

You will be asked to respond to these in an upcoming blog post:

1Ô∏è‚É£ [Creative Dialogue](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj598ZXODDO_6zEf_n-vicul4-SjQnL-W&feature=shared) series by Runway \(2023‚Äì2024\)

- Part 1: Claire Evans & Stephan Marche \(6min\)
- Part 2: Anna Ridler & Lex Fefegha \(6min\)
- Part 3: Golan Levin & Claire Hentschker \(6min\)

These optimistic videos were produced by the AI video company [Runway](https://runwayml.com/), and include some cool examples of generative image and video production. Each video features a great conversation between two artists who have worked with AI and other forms of generative technology, offering some inspiring ideas on the creative process and the role of automation.

This is a more skeptical take on AI art, that still uses historical examples to leave open the possiblity for noble and worthwhile uses of the technology. Doctorow is a legal scholar of the [copyleft movement](https://creativecommons.org/) and a science fiction author.



## Project Instructions

Use something generated by AI in your project. 

This could take the form of text, images, videos, music, or other media assets that you insert into a creative project. 

Or you could us AI tools as part of your process: to brainstorm ideas, discover visual inspiration, layouts, narratives, etc. For example, you could generate some AI poster designs, and then create higher quality posters yourself using colors and layout ideas from the AI-generated images. You could generate a list of possible design solutions to a UX problem, or a short story to illustrate with original comic artwork. 

Beyond process or materials, what should your project be ***about?*** That‚Äôs up to you, but you could consider the topics of artificial intelligence, automation, labor, robots, consciousness, human-ness, or other ideas related to the process we will use. Often when the concept of your work aligns with the form, sparks happen and everything becomes stronger. 

These topics are not required; you can choose any subject for your project and simply use AI tools to generate something.

**You should still be the primary author of the work** and spend appropriate time on the project every week. If AI generates _everything_, then you will need to justify what value you added as the human director. \(This is a pressing question for many industries right now!\) 

## Resources

üóìÔ∏è *As of August 2024 \(New tools or updates may be available\)*

Any text, images, or media you put into these tools may be used to train and improve AI programs. For that reason do not share overly private information or media; if you have concerns, contact your instructor. 

### Text

**Premium Choice:** [ChatGPT-4](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/): A paid upgrade on the free model, and you can use plugins to let it browse the web, execute code, and interact with third party APIs. 

**Free Recommendations:**

- [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/): Fast and easy to use, can generate code; cannot browse the web to find latest information.
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/): Competitive with GPT-4 and notable for having an insanely large context window, meaning you can paste in entire books for it to transform, summarize, or interact with. Maybe a bit more creative and thoughtful than ChatGPT, can generate but not run code, and a beautiful interface!
- [Bard](https://bard.google.com/): Google's AI chatbot can run code and "see" images to analyze them.
- [Google Docs](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/13951448?hl=en): You can generate and edit text directly in Google Docs. To request access, sign up for Google Workspace Labs at the link above. 
- [Lex](https://lex.page/): An AI-assisted text editor, if you prefer that to a chat interface. Write a document and let the AI continue your ideas, generate text, or develop notes into full text.

**Example propmts**:

- "How might a mobile app help library visitors engage with books in a new way?"
- "Write the copy for a landing page about an eco-conscious clothing company. Include section headings and use fun, pithy language that would appeal to teeangers."
- "I'm developing a fantasy video game, list some potential names for a magical island inhabited by ghosts, using elements from ancient languages."
- "Who are some artists working with animation and site-specific projection?"
- "Help me write a comic about a conversation between a robot and a butterfly. Use script formatting, and include a visual description of each frame."

Remember that you can follow-up your prompts with more specifics to "steer" the response in the direction you want. You might have to help the chatbot along a few times to produce the kind of results you're looking for. 

In the discovery phase, you can also tell a Chatbot to ask *you* questions to provoke introspection, as Geoffrey Litt demonstrates in his blog post, [ChatGPT as Muse, not Oracle](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2023/02/26/llm-as-muse-not-oracle). 


### Images

**Premium Choice**: [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/): A fantastic tool that is worth a month of subscription to try it out. Uses a simple interface via Discord, where you type commands to generate or modify images. Follow their [quick start guide](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/quick-start) and read about the many [commands](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/command-list) and [parameters](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/parameter-list) available to customize your results. 


**Free Recommendations:**

- [Bing Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/images/create): Uses DALL-E model, and is pretty great and easy to use. 
- [Adobe Firefly](https://firefly.adobe.com/): Notable for the fact that its AI model was trained exclusively on images Adobe owns \(through Adobe Stock\), so it is not exploiting artists by copying their style, if that's a concern for you. 
- [GetImg.Ai](https://getimg.ai/home): A variety of image creation tools, including the 2024 Flux model. 
- [Visual Electric](https://visualelectric.com/): A Figma-like interface to let you generate lots of images and arrange them together, remix them, and define styles. Free account gets 40 images per day.
- [Playground](https://playgroundai.com): A powerful GUI for generating images with Stable Diffussion; 1000 free images and licensed for commercial use. 


**Example Prompts**
- "A photograph of a man lounging under a tree on a summer afternoon, golden hour, cinematic bokeh, sepia colors."
- "A minimalist cartoon illustration of watermelon hugging a tomato, vibrant pop-art colors, radiating lines of energy." 

Use very descriptive language, references to specific art styles, camera terms, or art media. You can alter the prompt if the results aren't to your liking, and remember that Midjourney has very specific [parameters](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/parameter-list) to help guide the resulting images. 

Most of these tools will generate 4 images at once, and you can pick your favorite one to scale up to a higher resolution. 

üëâ For more examples of prompts and how generated images can be used in visual design, [check out this blog post ](https://benjaminandrew.net/posts/2024/ai-assets-for-designers/)by DMD faculty Benjamin Andrew. 

**Other Image Tools:**

- [DALL-E 3](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/): Owned by OpenAi, who makes Chat-GPT, this tool offers a limited number of free images before you have to pay for them.
- [Artbreeder](https://www.artbreeder.com/): Combine multiple input images and other visual remix tools.
- [Vizcom](https://www.vizcom.ai/): Generate realistic imagery through a combination of sketching \(!\) and text prompts. Popular with industrial and product design. Looks 3D but I think it just outputs images. 
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces): A vast library of user-created tools built on popular machine-learning systems, including some visual interfaces for the open source Stable Diffusion.
- [Spline Style Transfer](https://spline.design/ai-style-transfer): Spline is a cool web-based 3D modeling app, and while they're still working on a true "text-to-3D" model, you can use text prompts to generate images based on your 3D models, trying out new color or aesthetic ideas in an instant. 
- [Icons8 Upscaler](https://icons8.com/upscaler): Most generative image tools create fairly small images, so this AI tool can be used to scale them up them to larger sizes.

**Advanced Use of Stable Diffusion:** 

As an open-source model, you can do an awful lot with [Stable Diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/) if you're comfortable with some coding, including integrating it with other applications.
