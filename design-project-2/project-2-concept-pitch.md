# Concept pitch

The concept pitch is a presentation document that serves as a both a communication tool and as a means of ensuring that you develop a project with that can be reasonably accomplished in the given timeframe. This project concept pitch should have no less than 10 slides. The basic structure is as follows:

1. **Title slide**
   1. Title
   2. Name
   3. Date
   4. Course \("DMD 300: Digital Multimedia Design Studio"\)
   5. Semester \(Example: "Spring 2019"\)
2. **Bio**
   * Here you will list what you know, and what you are interested in. This should be related to the project concept. \(IE - if you are skilled and interested in web development, it would be confusing to then propose an animation project.\)
   * List existing digital media skills and other relevant skills.
   * List any skills you hope to obtain during this project.
3. **Concept**
   * Concise description of the project idea.
   * What’s interesting about it and or what is new/novel?
   * What Digital media is used?
   * What topics need to be researched?
   * Who is the audience for the work?
   * Which category 
4. **Project Type**
   * Specify which of the project categories and types your project falls under. 
   * Example: "2D Design, 3D Rendering, and Illustration: Typeface design"
   * If nothing on the list matches your idea exactly, describe it as best you can and still choose the closest category.
5. **Production Scope**
   * What are the deliverables to be completed or produced? \(IE - storyboards, interviews, web application, website, wireframes, animatics, character designs, scripts, game executable, video, etc.\)
6. **Production Pipeline**
   * What tools will be used?
   * What design processes and methods will be used?
   * Who will be involved \(list any collaborators, advisors, etc.\)?
   * Will you use management tools to keep on track?
7. **Required Capabilities**
   * What capabilities and skills are required to complete the project?
8. **Existing Capabilities**
   * Show past work that demonstrates your existing capabilities as related to the project concept.
9. **Needed Capabilities**
   * List any items from the Required Capabilities slide that are not in your Existing Capabilities slide.
   * Explain how you will you get up to speed in time.
10. **Timeline**
   * List steps in the production timeline.
   * Like we did in Project One, label the stages of your timeline with design objectives like "discovery" and "iteration" to describe *why you're doing each item* in the timeline.
11. **Research**
    * What areas of research do you intend to pursue during the production of this project?
    * What are your research resources?
11. **Questions for your project reviewers**
    * List three questions that might help you better some aspect of the project. Avoid vague questions such as, “Is this a good project?” or “What should I do?”. Instead focus your questions on the specific areas of your project that could benefit from feedback.
