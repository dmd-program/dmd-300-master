When you have finished your project, you will need to submit media files for display on the exhibition website. The online exhibition will only be visible to the Penn State community, but will be a great showcase of everyone's work and give you practice preparing this kind of documentation.

You are also submitting [project files](/project-2-project-files.md) which might include high-resolution images, master copies of videos, editable project files, and so on. The *exhibition files* are prepared especially for use on the web and will likely be a subset of what you produced. Choose the most impressive media that clearly summarizes what you did. 

## Media

Media files will vary from project to project, however, it is typical to have gallery images to highlight your project. The exhibition website uses a site generator, and is sensitive to file names. 

Please use the exact filename structures listed for each item below.

### Instructions:

**Download (Right click â†’ Save As):** [Media template files (5.9MB)](//assets/media-templates.zip)

Unless you are using a pseudonym, replace **[last-name]** in the file with your last name and **[first-name]** with your first name.

If you ARE using a pseudonym, please use it in place of **\[last-name\]\[first-name\]**.

#### Exhibition card image (required)

The exhibition card image will be the sole image displayed on the exhibition index page, along with other student's work. The project name and student name will be displayed below each card image.

* 1200px x 600px (landscape orientation)
* JPEG or PNG file
* Keep text to a minimum.
* Do not include the name of the project unless it is part of a logo or branding.

**File name:** `[last-name][first-name]-exhibition-card-image-1200x600.jpg`

#### Gallery images

Gallery images are shown on your project's profile page. Try to include between 3 to 12 images. Images can be close up views of details, documentation of process, etc. Do not include images larger than 1200px in any dimension. Use Photoshop to export `.jpg` images for display on the web at a compressed file size.

**File name:**

1. `[last-name][first-name]-gallery-image-01.jpg`
2. `[last-name][first-name]-gallery-image-02.jpg`
3. `[last-name][first-name]-gallery-image-03.jpg`
4. `[last-name][first-name]-gallery-image-##.jpg`


#### Video files

Video files require a poster image that is displayed before the video files loads. Youtube and Vimeo typically create these automatically, however, you will need to include one with your video file. If you have more than one video file, please match the numbering of the poster to the video file.

**Example poster image name:** `[last-name][first-name]-video-poster-01.jpg`

**Example video file name:** `[last-name][first-name]-video-01.mp4`

#### Interactive elements

If you are using an embedded interactive element, please include the embed code in a `.txt` file. If your interactive elements require many files to operate, please include a `.zip` file of those files.

**File name:**

`[last-name][first-name]-embed-01.txt` **or** `[last-name][first-name]-files-01.zip`

#### Audio

Convert audio files to `.mp3` so they may be playable from a web browser.

**Example audio files:** `[last-name][first-name]-audio.mp3`
