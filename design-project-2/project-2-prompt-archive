# Project 2

## Description

For this project, you will produce a digital design work that critically engages with the project's theme. You will also develop a design concept, production process, and a well-articulated work statement to explains your work to a wide audience. Your work will then be collectively displayed in a class-wide online exhibition.

## Project title and theme

**Project title template:** "_\[ topic \]_ Futures"

Choose a topic that is meaningful to you and apply it to the title template to assemble your project's title. The title is also the general theme of your project. For instance, to create work that engages in discourse of politics, you could create a theme called "Political Futures".

### Theme description

Futures projects are typically optimistic works that engage with important topics \(critical issues\) and examine the opportunities for improvement, change, activism, and betterment of a given situation. Futures projects are often categorized as speculative, discursive, or otherwise as critical design and tend to provide an array of potential outcomes. There are no hard definitions for how futures projects are created, but they often tend to mix fictional elements while maintaining firm grip with contemporary reality—meaning that futures projects often tend to take place or speculate about the future, yet have currency in present day life.

**Example futures projects and topics:**

* [Near Future Design](http://www.artisopensource.net/projects/near-future-design/)
* [AIGA Design futures](https://www.aiga.org/aiga-design-futures/introduction-to-design-futures/)

## Project media

If you are unsure of what types of digital projects are available to create, please have a look at the list of [digital design project types](/digital-design-project-types.md). This is not a comprehensive list, but you should be able to locate your own creative interests within.

## Online Exhibition

Exhibitions typically have a central theme—a conceptual thread that links the work together. Exhibition curators contextualize selected works which often ascribes new or additional meaning to the individual works as a result. The online exhibition's theme will be chosen after student projects are completed. DMD 300 online exhibitions are designed to run back to back, and will last until the next cohort of DMD 300 students participate. This makes the exhibition duration somewhat variable, but should not last more than one year and no less than a single semester. Your instructor will coordinate the exhibition, which will be available in two options; a Penn State only online exhibition, and a fully public online exhibition. Students choosing to participate in the fully public exhibition will also have their work shown in the Penn State only exhibition. Students participating in the Penn State only exhibition will not have work shown in the fully public exhibition. The fully public exhibition will be maintained on the DMD program website as an archive after the exhibition has ended—incorporating willing students' work into the program's heritage.

## Project Theme: *SLOW*

> Informed and inspired by the principles of the Slow Food and Slow Cities movements, the slow design principles offer a flexible, pluralistic approach for designers to gently evaluate themselves as to the true purpose of their design activities

— [The Slow Design Movement](https://www.archiblox.com.au/slow-design-movement/) by Archiblox

> Why is it so hard to slow down? I think there are various reasons. One is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy. It's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up. I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension — that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger, deeper questions.

– Carl Honoré [In Praise of slowness](https://www.ted.com/talks/carl_honore_in_praise_of_slowness) TED Talk

In the 1980s, the [slow food movement](https://www.slowfood.com/) began in Europe as a reaction to American fast food, and sought to promote traditional methods of farming and eating. The philosophy has spread to other sectors, where everything from architecture to product design can be designed to embrace local resources, sustainability, and an appreciation of quiet details. 

Today, the harmful effects of the attention-economy and the relentless optimization of digital experiences are widely recognized, including by artist Jenny Odell in her 2019 book [How To Do Nothing](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/600671/how-to-do-nothing-by-jenny-odell/9781612197494/). Odell sees the act of sitting still as a form of resistance in a world that seems to constantly speed up. For a shorter look at Odell's ideas and her artwork, see the link below.

**Recommended reading:** [How to Do Nothing](https://medium.com/@the_jennitaur/how-to-do-nothing-57e100f59bbb) by Jenny Odell — adapted from an EYEO 2017 keynote. 

“Slow Design” is a term used by some creators, and includes some specific attributes \(see below\), but you do not have to strictly adhere to its principles for this project. 

Explore the links below and consider how these approaches to creative work relate to your own interests. Rather than a multitude of fast-paced, low-interaction experiences, imagine longer, more nuanced ones: quality over quantity. You can explore the theme of slowness literally, or focus on related topics like sustainability, participatory design, mindfulness, anti-capitalism, or traditional crafts.

## Principles of Slow Design 

\(According to [Archiblox](https://www.archiblox.com.au/slow-design-movement/)\)

1. Reveal: Highlight things that might go unnoticed.
2. Expand: Look beyond obvious meanings and uses to discover potential applications.
3. Reflect: Create work that invites reflection and awareness of context.
4. Engage: Connect with open-source projects, collaborators, or communities. 
5. Participate: Invite users to participate in the design process.
6. Evolve: Imagine how your work will live on beyond the immediate future.
