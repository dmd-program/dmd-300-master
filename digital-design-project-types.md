# Digital Design Project Types

The following is a list of media that you might choose to work with in your projects for this class. This isn't comprehensive and people are always discovering new ways to create experiences and tell stories, but you can use this as a menu to browse and consider:

1. What form \(i.e. finished product\) will work best for communicating your content?
2. What skills or techniques do you want to master?

Additional resources for learning these fields can be found at the end of the course materials under [Project Categories](/project-categories.md), but your learning path will be largely self-directedâ€”with advice from your instructor of course!
